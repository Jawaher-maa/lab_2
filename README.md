The dataset contains tabular data about gym members and their fitness class bookings, including information such as membership duration, class type, booking time, and scheduling details. The data is provided in CSV/Excel format and is suitable for machine learning.

This project addresses a classification problem, where the target variable indicates whether a member attended a booked fitness class. The model is expected to learn patterns from the data to predict class attendance based on member and booking information.
